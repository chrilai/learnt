You live in in modern day Japan, where your parents are custodians of the local tourist attraction, a Shinto shrine dedicated to the kami (spirits) of the godai (five elements): chi (earth), sui (water), ka (fire), fu (wind), and ku (void or sky). It appears that your parents' stories have been all too real. There is a war brewing between the Elements that threatens to spill out into the Human Plane. And while you were able dismiss as coincidence a landslide, three fires, a windstorm and a flood, you were unable to ignore an eight foot tall Fire Spirit telling you that your parents had been kidnapped and needed rescuing!\n",
        "\n",
        "Talking flames notwithstanding, you were not about to toss out the Scientific Method. You pored over the notebooks painstakingly assembled by your parents and discovered the following facts:\n",
        "1. The well in the garden is a portal to the Elemental Plane which is itself composed of multiple minor planes.\n",
        "2. There are five types of minor plane, one for each element: earth, water, fire, wind, and void. The elemental planes are arranged in a grid that is n by m. Each plane is connected to its neighbors (up, down, left, right). \n",
        "3. Travel between the (minor) planes is accomplished by using the appropriate portal on the plane. The portal is located at a shrine. So if you're on an earth plane and wish to go the adjacent fire plane, you need to go to the fire shrine and use the portal there. Of course, the shrine for the plane you're on is not a portal. No plane has a portal of its element type, and no plane connects to more than one plane of the same type.\n",
        "4. Travel using the portals is somewhat random because of the mystical energies used to power them. From the notes, it appears that if you take portal, most of the time you end up at the desired destination but sometimes you end up on a different elemental plane.\n",
        "5. Each shrine is guarded by spirit who challenges you to a game. If you win, you may use the portal. If you lose, well, it appears the spirits are supposed to kill you but they're so bored and like playing games so much, they simply offer to play you another game.\n",
        "6. The portals deposit you at a random location on the destination plane (whether it is the intended one or a different one). Each plane has one of four possible geographies and these are determined by the positions of the sun (rising, setting, noon), the moon (waxing, waning) and the seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter).\n",
        "\n",
        "Fortunately, you are a student of computer science and have implemented the following programs to assist you on your quest:\n",
        "1. You will use a Q-Learning algorithm to create a plan for stochastic travel between elemental planes. You have calculated the following probabilities: earth(E)=65%, fire(F)=70%, water(W)=75%, wind(A)=80%, void(V)=85%.\n",
        "2. You will use A* search to travel through the minor planes and reach the desired shrine. You have calculated the following movement costs: plains(.)=1, forest(*)=3, hills(^)=5, water(~)=7, mountains(x)=impassible.\n",
        "3. You will use a decision tree to determine the map for a plane based on its characteristics.\n",
        "4. You will use successive elimination of dominated strategies to win your games against the guardians.\n",
        "\n",
