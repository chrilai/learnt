You can use tab . Try le<&lt;tab> and see the available functions.\n2.  You can change the type of cell by picking \"Code\" or \"Markdown\" from the menu at the left.\n3.  If you keep typing in a Markdown text area, you will eventually get scroll bars. To prevent this, hit return when you come to\nthe end of the window. Only a double return creates a new paragraph.\n4.  You can find out more about Markdown text here: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ (Copy this link and put it \nin another tab for reference--Don't click it or you'll leave your notebook!).\n5.  Every so often, restart the kernel, clear all output and run all code cells so you can be certain that you didn't\ndefine something out of order.\n\n**You should rename this notebook to be &lt;your JHED id>\\_PR2.ipynb** Do it right now.\n\n**Make certain the entire notebook executes before you submit it.** (See Hint #5 above)\n\nChange the following variables:"

I made a decision to eliminate weakly dominated strategies because I found that there were many cases in which there are no strongly dominated strategies, and it would still make sense for a player to eliminate the weakly dominated strategies.\n\nI had some difficulty with getting my program to run at first, as I was successively removing values from a game strategy matrix and had to keep track of the bounds. I think that if I were to complete this assignment again, I would create a boolean matrix or add an indicator to tag which strategies have been eliminated. This would make it easier to return the strategy pair rather than the payoff as the solution."
