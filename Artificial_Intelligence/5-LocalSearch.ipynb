You can use tab . Try le<&lt;tab> and see the available functions.\n2.  You can change the type of cell by picking \"Code\" or \"Markdown\" from the menu at the left.\n3.  If you keep typing in a Markdown text area, you will eventually get scroll bars. To prevent this, hit return when you come to\nthe end of the window. Only a double return creates a new paragraph.\n4.  You can find out more about Markdown text here: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ (Copy this link and put it \nin another tab for reference--Don't click it or you'll leave your notebook!).\n5.  Every so often, restart the kernel, clear all output and run all code cells so you can be certain that you didn't\ndefine something out of order.\n\n**You should rename this notebook to be &lt;your JHED id>_PR5\\.ipynb** Do it right now.\n\n**Make certain the entire notebook executes before you submit it.** (See Hint #5 above)\n\nChange the following variables:"

     "source": "**Comments/observations/what I learned:**\n\nAs I mentioned in the class discussion forums, I implemented the algorithms in such a way that they can arrive at the target from any string of any length, with the empty string [\"\"] as the default starting point. Since it turned out that this was not a requirement, I have also included alternate statements that can be used to generate random strings of the same length as the target as the starting point for each algorithm, which would allow us to arrive at the solution in fewer iterations. The fitness evaluation function prioritizes matching the length of the string over the characters in the string. This allows us to first focus on matching the target length before focusing on matching each individual character in the target.\n\nThe greatest difficulty I encountered was similar to that in the previous assignment, in which we needed to balance exploration and exploitation. It took me some time to create a stochastic successor function for hill-climbing that randomized successor states adequately enough to approach the target state at a decent pace, but not so deeply as to prevent convergence on the target state. I solved this by adding a tolerance factor for randomness based upon the distance from the target, using a principle that was similar to simulated annealing but independent of time. I found that my implementation of the genetic algorithm arrived at the solution somewhat more quickly since the method for generating successor states did a good job of creating states that viably progressed toward the target state. When I examined the step-by-step iteration for each algorithm, it seemed like there were a lot of rejected candidate successor states. Increasing the number of successor states at each step to a higher number would reduce the number of iterations required to find successor states that are better than the current state, but would not actually make the program run any faster.\n\nIn a typical local search problem, we would be optimizing a value without a given target, as it would be infeasible to determine the global optimum. We would then want to periodically save the best candidate state and restart the search whenever a local optimum has been reached. Given more time, I would try to extend my implementation to work for other local search problems. I would also try to make the fitness calculation and successor generation functions better account for substring similarities to the target state. This would improve the selection of successor states, thereby reducing the number of iterations taken before arriving at a solution. The genetic algorithm should use an accumulated fitness function that takes into account the fitness of ancestor states."
